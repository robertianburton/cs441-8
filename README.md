# cs441-8
cs441 final project

For my project, I'll be doing something I've wanted to do for a while and construct an easy to use **ranked choice** voting app. Polls will be created based on a user's email and a poll-specific password. When people open the app, they can see the available polls. Another tab will be for creating polls. Poll owner can decide when to close poll. Possibly a web page for displaying results using a nice js tool.
