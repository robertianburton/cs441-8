# Final Vote
cs441 final project

For my project, I've be done something I've wanted to do for a while and constructed an easy to use **ranked choice** voting app. Polls are super simple to set up. When people open the app, they can see the available polls. Another tab is for creating polls. Another tab is where you can vote, selecting your first choice, second, third, etc. This voting order is sent to a backend. When the votes are recalled, the results can be tabulated (the choice with the fewest votes has its votes redistributed based on the people's latter choices). Still possibly making a web page for displaying results using a nice js tool.
